Welcome to the repository for my front end capstone, Coding Help. Coding Help is a social media type plateform that allows developers to post any issues they may be having with their code, and with the help of other devs on the site, find a solution. We also have employees of the site that can help any user if they make a special help request to any of our employees.
This project was made using React and JSON server. If you would like to check out the project, feel free to pull the code down and run it locally using npm start. You'll also need to checkout my CapstoneAPI repository on my GitHub, clone into it, and run the json server using json-server database.json -p 8088 -w (the project currently uses JSON for it's server, and currently only works if json runs locally)
